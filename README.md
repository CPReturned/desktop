# CPReturned Desktop Application

We strongly recommend using the CPReturned Desktop Application over the web game, to allow you to
use all features of the game.

### How do I know it's safe?

All the code for this desktop application is open source and you can browse it here. Click 
"Releases" on the right to get straight to the download page.

All releases are automatically created by the GitHub Actions workflow in this repository, which
provides a secure and transparent way to distribute the application. We don't manually upload EXE
or DMG files to the releases page.
